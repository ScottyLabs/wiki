# Mail Aliases

If you were allocated a scottylabs/tartanhacks email, you can add the address as
an alias to your andrew.cmu.edu address. The club does not have a dedicated email
client, so the address is only a forwarding address to your Andrew email.

## Set Up Instructions

1. Once you have your address allocated, open your CMU Email (Gmail) page and navigate
   to the settings page. (Top Right Corner)

2. Navigate to the All Settings page (See all settings).

3. Open Accounts and Import tab. Under the **Send mail as** section, click **Add another email address**. This will open a new window.

4. Input your desired name and the alias email address (e.g., user@scottylabs.org). Keep the **Treat as an alias** checkboxed checked and proceed to the next page.

5. Fill out the following fields as follows:

| Field       | Value                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SMTP Server | smtp.mailgun.org                             |
| Port        | 587                                          |
| Username    | postmaster@scottylabs.org                    |
| Password    | _Request from ~tech-help-desk on Mattermost_ |
| TLS/SSL     | TLS                                          |

6. You will receive an email from CMU/Gmail asking you to verify the address. Click the verification link
   to complete the process.
