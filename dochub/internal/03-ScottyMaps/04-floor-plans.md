# Floor Plans

## Downloading Floor Plans

3. Go to this [link](https://www.cmu.edu/finance/property-space/floorplan-room/) and navigate to the building you wish to map.
4. Download the `.pdf` file for the desired floor under the `Shown by Room Number` list.
   - Make sure to save the floor plan in the correct directory under `buildings`. If one does not exist, create a new directory for the building using its abbreviated name.
   - Continuing the previous example, I would navigate to this [page](https://www.cmu.edu/finance/property-space/floorplan-room/acad-admin/GHC/index.html) and download `Floor 5 [.pdf]` from the leftmost list.
5. Convert the `.pdf` floor plan into a `.png` image. You can use an [online converter](https://cloudconvert.com/pdf-to-png) or any local application that you are familiar with. Save the `.png` image in the same folder as before.
   - Make sure to use at least 300 DPI when converting so the resulting image is still sharp when zoomed in.

## Orienting the Floor Plan

:::note

This section will differ depending on whether or not the building you are currently mapping already has a floor mapped.
Please follow the instructions from the correct section:

- [Building has a floor mapped](#floor-exists)
- [No floors have been mapped](#no-floor-exists)

### Floor Exists

Throughout this section, I will be using an example where I am mapping NSH 3 when NSH 4 has already been mapped.

1. Open JOSM
2. Press `Ctrl + O` or go to `File > Open` and open the `cmu.osm` file in the root of the map data repo.
3. Also open the `.osm` file for the

### No Floor Exists

1. Open JOSM
2. Press `Ctrl + O` or go to `File > Open` and open the `cmu.osm` file in the root of the map data repo.
3. Click on `Imagery > New picture layer from file...`
   - This option may be under `Imagery > More...`
4. Open the `.png` file you just converted.
